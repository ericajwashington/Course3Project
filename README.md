# Data Science Coursera - Course 3 Project

## This project creates a tiny dataset by merging several sets.
 
### The repository for this analysis includes the codebook.
### Statistics in the set are means for several activity types, and are explained in comments in the R set.
### Running this set in R should work as long as the loaded data are saved to the same repo.

### 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
### 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
### 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
### 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
### 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average 
###    of each variable for each activity and each subject.
